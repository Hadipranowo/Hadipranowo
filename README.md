ðŸ‘‹ Hi, just call me Hadi. I am from Indonesia and currently work as a React/React Native developer.

I dont have many software knowledge prior to my current career, I came from engineering degree, mostly learn about hardware rather than software. 

My first career as software programmer was back in 2020, when Covid19 pandemic arises in many countries, forcing a change from traditional work-from-office schema into a digital work-from-anywhere style, and digital/software based product was booming that days.

I started my carrer as a React Native (mobile) developer with the help of bootcamp from CodingID and since then doing a self-learning to expand my knowledge in software engineering.
